Hello reviewer,

I did not use any rest framework but I did use the mongoDB driver for nodejs. You can start the app using ``` npm install && node server.js``` after installing and starting MongoDB on port 27017. I did not use any ajax for developing this application, most testing was done using curl commands. There are some listed inside of curls.txt in case you would like to test in this manner.
